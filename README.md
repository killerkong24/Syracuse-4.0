# Syracuse-v4.0

a skid client built off Syracuse but aims to fix most of the issues present in Syracuse-v3.0 (overall it being a shit client 
with a bad owner and worse modules) by adding some code of my own and modules of my own

# code
Note: most of the code i added to Syracuse (https://github.com/Volcan4436/Syracuse-3.0-source-leak) 
ISNT my own most of the code is taken for aidshark, and CwHack although i did add some of my own.
